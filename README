PyDG200 allows you to configure and download tracks from US Global Sat DG200
data logger. Tracks are downloaded as gpx files with date and time as names, in
a chosen folder.

Requirements:
    - python 3.
    - python-gobject for the gtk+ interface (thus all the gtk+ libraries which
      should come as dependencies of python-gobject).
    - python3-pyserial for serial communications.

Possible udev rule to get access to the data logger as simple user:


# serial
KERNEL=="tty[A-Z]*|pppox*|ircomm*|noz*", GROUP="uucp", MODE="0666"
